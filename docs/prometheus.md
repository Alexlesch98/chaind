# Prometheus metrics
chaind provides a number of metrics to check the health and performance of its activities.  chaind's default implementation uses Prometheus to provide these metrics.  The metrics server listens on the address provided by the `metrics.prometheus.listen-address` configuration value.

## Version
The version of chaind can be found in the `chaind_release` metric, in the `version` label.

## Health
Health metrics provide a mechanism to confirm if chaind is active.

`chaind_start_time_secs` is the Unix timestamp at which chaind was started.  This value will remain the same throughout a run of chaind; if it increments it implies that chaind has restarted.

`chaind_ready` is `1` if chaind's services are all on-line and it is able to operate.  If not, this will be `0`.

## Operations
Operations metrics provide information about numbers of operations performed.  These are generally lower-level information that can be useful to monitor activities for fine-tuning of server parameters, comparing one instance to another, _etc._
